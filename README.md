# Heart Disease Analysis & Prediction

This project is dedicated to analyze the heart disease dataset and developing predictive models using machine learning. It leverages various datasets along with preprocessing and visualization techniques, primarily using Python libraries.

## Project Structure

- **heart_disease.ipynb**  
  Main Jupyter Notebook with exploratory data analysis, preprocessing steps, and model setup.
- **processed.cleveland.data**  
  Processed heart disease dataset.
- **README.md**
  This file. 


## Prerequisites & Libraries

Before running the notebook or scripts, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **Jupyter Lab**
- **pandas** – for data manipulation and analysis (`pip install pandas`)
- **numpy** – for numerical computations (`pip install numpy`)
- **scikit-learn** – for machine learning algorithms and preprocessing (`pip install scikit-learn`)
- **matplotlib** / **seaborn** – for data visualization (`pip install matplotlib seaborn`)

Additional libraries may be required depending on your analysis needs. Check the notebook for any additional dependencies.
